# Library Management System - Debug Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Authentication System Issues

#### Problems:
- Users could register but couldn't log in successfully
- No error messages displayed on the login form for invalid credentials
- Password verification was failing due to Base64 encoding/decoding issues

#### Solutions:
- Fixed the `VerifyPasswordHash` method in `UserService.cs` to properly handle Base64 encoding
- Added appropriate error handling and display on the login form
- Ensured admin user is always created with the correct password hash
- Updated login to use email address instead of username

### 2. Database Schema Issues

#### Problems:
- Missing `CoverImagePath` column in the Books table
- Database migration not properly applying new schema changes
- Sample data INSERT statements not including the new column

#### Solutions:
- Updated the `init.sql` script to include the `CoverImagePath` column
- Created a `rebuild.sh` script to easily rebuild the entire stack with database reset
- Added documentation for database rebuilding in `deployment.md`

### 3. "Under Construction" Pages

#### Problems:
- Many pages were showing "Under Construction" placeholders:
  - Manage Books
  - Manage Users
  - Checkouts
  - Change Password
  - Edit Profile

#### Solutions:
- Implemented full functionality for all missing pages
- Added book cover upload functionality to Manage Books
- Added proper user profile editing capabilities
- Implemented password change functionality
- Added checkout management features

### 4. Frontend Component Issues

#### Problems:
- "Edit Profile" button was not working
- Check-out books section displayed errors
- Dashboard statistics were not loading
- TypeScript errors in the codebase

#### Solutions:
- Fixed the routing for Edit Profile button
- Added proper error handling for book checkout display
- Fixed API integration for dashboard statistics
- Corrected TypeScript type definitions

### 5. API Integration Issues

#### Problems:
- Frontend could not properly communicate with backend APIs
- Error responses were not being properly handled
- Missing endpoints for some functionality

#### Solutions:
- Enhanced API service with better error handling
- Updated DTOs to match between frontend and backend
- Added proper authentication header management
- Implemented missing API endpoints

## Current Status

All identified issues have been fixed, and the application is now fully functional:

1. Authentication system works correctly with email-based login
2. Database schema includes all required columns
3. All pages have been implemented with full functionality
4. Book cover upload works correctly
5. User profile management and password changes function properly
6. Book checkout and return functionality works as expected

## Default Admin Login

An admin user is automatically created on first database initialization:
- Email: admin@library.com
- Password: Admin123!

## Deployment Instructions

The application can be deployed using Docker with the following commands:

```bash
# For a clean rebuild (with database reset):
./rebuild.sh -f

# For a regular rebuild (preserving data):
./rebuild.sh
```

See `deployment.md` for more detailed deployment instructions.
