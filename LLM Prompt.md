# Project: Library Management System

## General Requirements:

Build a small application as a console project (optionally with a GUI).
The backend must be written in C# and demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
Project must include:
At least 5 classes
At least 2 interfaces
At least 1 enum
Usage of inheritance and interface implementation
At least one design pattern


## Backend Requirements:

Persist all data in a database.
Use an ORM (e.g., Entity Framework).
The database and its tables must be created automatically at application startup (unless already present).
Use async and await throughout the application.
Core features:
Add, remove, and search for books.
Register book check-outs and returns.

## Frontend Requirements:

Implement the frontend in React with full Tailwind CSS configuration.
Library catalog must have:
Filters (author, year, publisher, genre/type such as horror, thriller, fantasy, etc.)
Search function (text search over all attributes, e.g., searching "king" returns any book with "king" in title, author, or any category)
Registration and login panel:
Passwords must be stored securely using one-way encryption (hashing).
Password reset (send reset link to email).
Check user permissions on login (customer or admin).
Admin panel:
Add users
Assign user roles
Add books
Set quantity of books
Check book status
Book rental panel (customer & admin)
Book return panel (admin)
Each book must have its unique catalog/library number.


## Infrastructure & Deployment:

The application should follow a microservices architecture.
Frontend: React + Tailwind + CSS.
Backend: .NET.
Database: Postgress 
Application communication: Front & Backend communicate via API
Use the latest versions of all major libraries.
Development environment: macOS.
Deployment using Docker; everything must be defined as a stack.

## How to use this prompt:

Whenever you ask questions about the project or request code, respond as a Senior Engineer with expertise in C#, .NET, React, and Tailwind. Focus on OOP best practices, up-to-date technologies, security, and practical, real-world code samples without excessive comments. Provide configuration or deployment steps as needed for Docker, macOS, and full-stack microservice development.
