# Language Localization Implementation Summary

## Work Done

1. **Set up i18next Framework**:
   - Created i18n.ts file as the main internationalization configuration
   - Configured language detector to detect user's preferred language
   - Set up resource structure for English and Polish translations
   - Configured fallback to English when translations are missing
   - Added localStorage caching for language preferences

2. **Defined Translation Structure**:
   - Created a structure that imports translation files from locale-specific folders
   - Set up resources object to manage multiple languages
   - Applied proper initialization settings for the i18next library

## Work Needed

1. **Create Translation JSON Files**:
   - Create directory structure: `/locales/en/translation.json` and `/locales/pl/translation.json`
   - Identify all text strings in the application that need translation
   - Organize strings in a logical structure within JSON files

2. **Component Integration**:
   - Update all components to use the translation system
   - Replace hardcoded text with translation keys (`t('key')`)
   - Implement language switcher component in the UI

3. **Application Integration**:
   - Import i18n in main app entry point (index.tsx or App.tsx)
   - Wrap application with appropriate i18n providers
   - Test language switching functionality

4. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Handle dynamic content with interpolation
   - Implement plural forms where needed
   - Support formatting of dates, numbers, and currency

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Add language persistence between sessions
   - Implement language detection based on browser settings
   - Consider adding more languages in the future using the same pattern

6. **Testing**:
   - Test language switching
   - Verify all components display correct translations
   - Test fallback behavior for missing translations

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document how to add new translation keys
   - Create guidelines for translators
   - Document the language switching process
