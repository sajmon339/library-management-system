# Library Management System - Project Summary

## What Has Been Done

1. **Backend Development**
   - Created a .NET Core API for the library management system
   - Implemented controllers for Books, Users, CheckOuts, and Authentication
   - Set up Entity Framework for database operations
   - Created models for Book, User, CheckOut, and Genre
   - Implemented services for business logic
   - Added JWT authentication

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Built a React application with TypeScript
   - Implemented responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
   - Created pages for home, login, books, and admin dashboard
   - Set up API services for communication with backend
   - Added protected routes for authenticated users
   - Implemented modern UI components

3. **Database**
   - Created initial schema with SQL scripts
   - Added migrations for User and CheckOut models
   - Set up relationships between tables

4. **Docker Setup**
   - Created Docker configuration for backend, frontend, and database
   - Set up docker-compose for easy deployment

## Current Problem - Login Functionality

The main issue currently affecting the system is the login functionality:

1. **Authentication Flow Issues**
   - Users are unable to authenticate properly
   - JWT tokens may not be correctly generated or handled
   - The AuthContext in the frontend might not be storing or applying tokens correctly

2. **Backend Authentication**
   - The AuthController might have incorrect validation logic
   - JWT service may not be properly signing or validating tokens
   - Possible issues with password hashing or verification

3. **Frontend Issues**
   - Login form submission might not be properly handling API responses
   - Token storage in localStorage or sessionStorage could be problematic
   - Protected routes may be incorrectly configured

4. **Specific Symptoms**
   - Login attempts result in authentication failures
   - Users cannot access protected routes even after attempting to log in
   - Possible error messages in console related to JWT or authorization

## Next Steps

1. Debug the authentication flow by:
   - Checking JWT token generation in the backend
   - Verifying token storage and application in the frontend
   - Testing the login API endpoint separately
   - Examining the AuthContext implementation

2. Fix identified issues in:
   - AuthController.cs
   - JwtService.cs
   - Login.tsx or ModernLogin.tsx
   - AuthContext.tsx

3. Implement proper error handling and user feedback for authentication failures
